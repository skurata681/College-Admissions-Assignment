# College-Admissions-Assignment
This repository contains files used to develop the College Admissions Assignment (adapted from that created at the University of Colorado Boulder https://drive.google.com/file/d/14JTV0MprvP7AQTlXOaoahE1XYSLJxwLz/view) to be used for Lab 6 in Critical EECS 183 at the University of Michigan.
Note: The Python version of this assignment relies on the original assignment linked above. The C++ version has its own assignment written, linked here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vQznI4IHiUXTrEx_Cft_y1lxoPrhWh3JXald-iTfSV8/edit?usp=sharing .
